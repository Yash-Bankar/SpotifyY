## üõ† How to Use ‚Äî quick web usage

This project is designed to be used as a hosted web app (example: `https://spotify-y.vercel.app/`). Below are the **site-specific behaviors** you‚Äôll see on desktop vs mobile ‚Äî concentrate on the UI differences and how playlists are accessed.

### ‚úÖ Desktop (PC) ‚Äî site behavior

1. **Open the hosted site** in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. **Left sidebar ‚Äî Your Library:** playlists appear in a persistent left column (library). Use this to navigate between playlists.
3. **View playlist:** clicking any playlist in the left sidebar filters the main grid to show only songs from that playlist.
4. **Return to All Songs:** click the **home / All Songs** button or the site logo at the top to reset the view and show every song again.
5. **Play a song:** click a song card in the main grid ‚Äî the bottom player will show playback controls, seek bar and volume.
6. **Keyboard:** Spacebar toggles Play/Pause; media keys (if available) also work.

### ‚úÖ Phone (Mobile) ‚Äî site behavior

1. **Open the hosted site** in your mobile browser (Chrome or Safari recommended).
2. **Hamburger (Library) menu:** on mobile there is a hamburger icon (top-right). Tap it to open **Your Library** ‚Äî this drawer contains your playlists.
3. **Tap a playlist:** selecting a playlist from the drawer filters the main view to show only that playlist's songs (same behavior as desktop filtering).
4. **Return to All Songs:** tap the **All Songs** label or the Home icon to go back to the full library.
5. **Start playback:** mobile browsers require a user tap to begin audio ‚Äî just tap a song card to play. Controls appear at the bottom of the screen.

> Note: This README focuses on the hosted-site experience ‚Äî if you do want to run the project locally for development, a short note is at the end of the repo, but the UI behavior described above is the same when the site is served.

## üéõ Behavior details (UX)

* **Playlist filtering:** when you click/tap a playlist (in the left sidebar on PC or the hamburger library on mobile), the main grid updates to show only the songs that belong to that playlist.
* **Return to All Songs:** there is a Home / All Songs button ‚Äî tap it to reset the view and show all songs again.
* **Mobile library:** the extra hamburger icon on mobile opens the library drawer that contains the playlists (as seen in screenshots). This mimics a native app drawer.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è My Favorite Songs

This section is reserved for your personal favorites. (No song names are listed here by default.)

* To add your favourites to the README, you can either:

  * Paste a short list of song titles below this heading, or
  * Add a `Favorites` playlist entry to `songs.json` so it shows inside the app.

> Tip: If you want me to add a `Favorites` snippet to `songs.json`, I can generate it once you confirm the filenames.

---

## üñº Screenshots (add your images here)

Include screenshots to visually demonstrate the desktop and mobile behaviors. Recommended screenshots (filenames suggested):

1. **pc-main.png** ‚Äî Desktop main view showing all songs and the left library.
2. **pc-playlist-open.png** ‚Äî Desktop view after clicking a playlist (filtered view).
3. **mobile-home.png** ‚Äî Mobile main screen (shows song grid and top bar with hamburger icon).
4. **mobile-library.png** ‚Äî Mobile library drawer open (shows playlists list).
5. **mobile-playing.png** ‚Äî Mobile player in playing state (bottom controls + lock-screen/notification sample if available).

### How to embed screenshots in this README

Place your images in the repo (recommended path: `docs/screenshots/`) then embed using Markdown, for example:

```markdown
### Desktop ‚Äî All songs
![Desktop main view](docs/screenshots/pc-main.png)

### Desktop ‚Äî Playlist filtered
![Desktop playlist view](docs/screenshots/pc-playlist-open.png)

### Mobile ‚Äî Home
![Mobile home view](docs/screenshots/mobile-home.jpg)

### Mobile ‚Äî Library drawer
![Mobile library drawer](docs/screenshots/mobile-library.jpg)

### Mobile ‚Äî Playing
![Mobile playing view](docs/screenshots/mobile-playing.jpg)
```

**Image recommendations:** JPG or PNG, width \~1200px for desktop screenshots, \~800px for mobile. Name images exactly (no spaces) to keep the markdown simple.

## üîß Adding `Favorites` to `songs.json`

To make the favorites show up inside the player, add a `Favorites` key to your `songs.json`. Example:

```json
{
  "Favorites": [
    "songs/PlaylistA/songA.mp3",
    "songs/PlaylistB/songB.mp3"
  ],
  "PlaylistA": [
    "songs/PlaylistA/songA.mp3"
  ]
}
```

Make sure file names and folders match the real files inside `img/songs/`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **Player shows no songs** ‚Äî check `songs.json` for valid JSON and correct file paths.
* **Images not loading** ‚Äî ensure `.jpg` covers exist next to each `.mp3`.
* **No audio on mobile** ‚Äî tap the player once (user gesture) to enable audio. Autoplay is blocked on mobile.

---

## üîß Customization

* Add playlists or songs via `songs.json`.
* Swap icons in `/svg/`.
* Modify colors and layout in `style.css`.

---

## üß† Technologies Used

* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

---

If you want, I can now:

* Embed actual screenshots into the README for you ‚Äî upload the images and I will insert the Markdown image tags in the correct places.
* Generate a ready-to-copy `songs.json` `Favorites` snippet using exact filenames from your repo if you confirm them.

Tell me which you want next.
